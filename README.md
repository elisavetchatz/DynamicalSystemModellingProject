# Simulation and Modeling of Dynamic Systems
## Part 1: System Identification of a Damped Pendulum using Least Squares

This project focuses on the modeling, simulation, and parameter estimation of a damped pendulum system using MATLAB. Through a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical experimentation, it applies the Least Squares (LS) method to estimate the physical parameters of the system, under different levels of state observability, noise, sampling configurations, and excitation amplitudes.

### Project Scope

- ðŸ“Œ **System:** Second-order linearized pendulum with damping and external torque input.
- ðŸ“Œ **Objective:** Estimate the unknown parameters \( m \), \( L \), and \( c \) from state/output measurements.
- ðŸ“Œ **Methodology:** Least Squares estimation using sampled simulation data in MATLAB.
- ðŸ“Œ **Experiments:**
  - Full vs Partial state observability (with and without \( \dot{q}(t) \))
  - Noise robustness
  - Effect of sampling period \( T_s \)
  - Effect of input amplitude \( A_0 \)
